    Over the last few days you will have seen the blogs coming out from the boffins
    in our engineering teams about Mass Testing, Long Lag and Thin Clients. In some
    of these blogs you will have seen reference to &lsquo;Core' teams and so I wanted
    to take this chance to introduce the Core Technology Group (CTG), let you know what
    it is we do and where we sit within the CCP development structure.</p>
<p>
    At the end of June, our CEO Hilmar Veigar Petursson referred to CCP's Core Technology
    Platform at his opening keynote of China GDC. For some time now, we have been internally
    branding the framework we use to build all of our games as "Carbon."</p>
<p>
    Giving the framework a name helps us a lot with communication internally and of
    course to you, the wonderful players of EVE Online. There is also the old Icelandic
    saying of "if you know its name, you can kill it", which basically talks about the
    power of knowing the names of things and how that gives you the ability to control
    said phenomena. As complex and multifaceted as our Carbon framework is then we certainly
    benefit from all the help we can get to wield it. And the custodians of Carbon are
    the Core Technology Group.</p>
<p>
    This video shows some of the Carbon technology in action as was presented by two
    CTG members at GDC this year.</p>

<h2>
    So, why have Carbon and what is it really?</h2>
<p>
    As CCP and EVE continue to grow, it makes sense for us to consider our existing
    technologies and re-use these if appropriate across our projects as part of the
    Carbon framework. This becomes more appealing if those technologies are proven (or,
    as we call it, &lsquo;battletested') in the crucible that is a game being used by
    a passionate, resourceful and sometimes devious player base. Furthermore, as our
    new projects continue to mature, we can take the technologies developed by them
    and apply them to EVE. This means that the EVE development teams get some great
    new technologies which it hasn't had to spend any developer time creating. Having
    the CTG take the strain making this happen ensures the EVE developers can concentrate
    on developing EVE and make best use of this common technology.</p>
<p>
    It also makes sense for a central group (the CTG) to build brand new Carbon technologies
    which we know can be shared. This group can then deploy and support the technology
    across CCP to whoever needs or wants to use it.</p>
<h2>
    So what is the Carbon technology framework?</h2>
<p>
    Well, it is mostly things which operate at a low level in our games. The idea is
    that the framework will consist of all of the key technology pieces for an MMO that
    our game teams can pick up and use. The Trinity2 graphics engine was the first piece
    of Carbon technology (even if we didn't know it as Carbon back then) introduced
    back in late 2007 by the newly formed Core group. Since then, various parts of our
    technology have been &lsquo;Carbonised' such as the graphics refresh that happened
    as part of Apocrypha. You can refer back to these Dev Blogs for details of things
    which have been made part of Carbon in the past.</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=584">StacklessIO</a></p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=676">Core Tech - the beginning</a></p>
<p>
    Of course, just creating and deploying new or existing technology, even if it is
    &lsquo;battletested', is only part of the story. The CTG also spends a significant
    portion of its time re-working, re-writing and re-engineering parts of our codebase
    in a continuous effort to keep it up to date as technology advances. This also allows
    us to prepare the codebase to accept &nbsp;new technologies into the Carbon framework,
    allowing us to keep pushing the boundaries of what EVE Online can be.</p>
<h2>
    Who is in the Core Technology Group?</h2>
<p>
    Well, the CTG started, as mentioned earlier, with a few graphics programmers working
    under the direction of our Chief Technology Officer to produce the next generation
    of the EVE graphics engine. From that small beginning, we have been hiring new people
    into CCP in order to fill a number of teams. The CTG is a separate group within
    CCP, it is not part of EVE. We do not count as part of the EVE headcount and we
    have a separate budget and hiring plan. However, in reality we work very closely
    with EVE although Core does not work on game features. We provide the reprocessed
    minerals that &nbsp;the game teams then use to, in the case of EVE, build your serious
    internet spaceships.</p>
<p>
    We currently have 5 teams within the CTG, although we do use carefully chosen 3<sup>rd</sup>
    parties when needed. <a title="Futuremark" href="http://www.futuremark.com/companyinfo/aboutus/"
        target="_blank">Futuremark</a> is a good example where we are working with them
    on a new part of the graphics rendering engine. It must be noted that whilst the
    CTG teams all work on Carbon, some parts of Carbon are not maintained by the CTG.
    These are usually specialist areas which can be managed by the team which has that
    expertise. Animation is a prime example. The animation team is based in Atlanta
    and the work they are doing will be part of Carbon.</p>
<p>
    The 5 Core Technology Group teams consist of the following...</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 x Core Graphics Teams (12 people):</span></p>
<p>
    These teams are those working in the bowels of Trinity2, making it perform better,
    provide sexier visuals and use more up-to-date technology. The Carbon Character
    Technology video from earlier in this blog demonstrates a small portion of their
    work-in-progress. As you can see, this team has been working on the graphics technology
    for avatars and the environments they will inhabit. For EVE that's Incarna. These
    guys also develop and maintain our in-house tools system, &lsquo;Jessica', which
    is used by pretty much every developer in CCP and contains the Trinity2 rendering
    engine. As requests for improvements, new functionality or bug fixes come in from
    the EVE developers, the Core Graphics guys get on the case and deliver. Jessica
    is also used by the EVE video team in making all of our trailers, allowing them
    serious time-saving shortcuts in staging assets for dramatic narrative effect.</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Core EVE Graphics Team (3 people):</span></p>
<p>
    This team consists of three Core Graphics developers who are 100% assigned to EVE,
    working as part of a nine person EVE development scrum. Due to the demands of working
    in a cross-project, multinational company, parts of the CTG must occasionally shift
    its focus onto a particular project on a temporary basis. When this concentration
    is not on EVE (currently it is), the Core EVE Graphics team provides the link and
    continuity of Core involvement in the graphics side of EVE. By staying 100% laser
    focused, they make sure EVE continues to get the Core graphics programmer support
    it needs. You may have seen the recent Dev Blog by CCP Blaze about <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=774">
        Tyrannis Performance Improvements</a> who is on this team. These guys are instrumental
    &nbsp;in working closely with the EVE Art team to bring you new ships, planets and
    other graphical wonders.</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Core Infrastructure Team (4 people):</span></p>
<p>
    This team is really at the heart of everything we are able to put out to our customers
    at CCP. These guys have created a common set of Productivity software, tools and
    technology which allows us to build more efficiently EVE and its patches from the
    source code, significantly reducing the time it takes to make EVE. This team has
    also built the <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=775">repair
        tool</a> which CCP Mandrake blogged about recently. In addition, this team has
    been working for a long time on delivering a way for our developers to be able to
    stress test EVE when they are developing new features or investigating and fixing
    bugs. We are now rolling this out and you can read more in the Dev Blog from CCP
    Atropos about the <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=779">
        Thin Clients</a>. I believe this is a significant step forward in how we are
    able to build and maintain EVE, allowing us to deliver a virtual world that we are
    much more confident is able to operate as we intend when we have record numbers
    of players hammering our servers and software.</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Core Cluster Team (7 people)</span></p>
<p>
    What is one of the cornerstones of EVE? Lots of people interacting in a single universe
    without sharding. Obviously, EVE has scaled to dizzying heights over the last 7+
    years and we now have more players than ever immersed in New Eden. However, we know
    that there are problems and we know we have to be constantly fighting to help the
    EVE cluster scale well beyond where it is now. This important task rests on many
    people all across CCP, from operations and virtual world staff to the EVE software
    developers to the EVE game designers and beyond. A key element in the fight to improve
    how we scale and reduce &lsquo;Lag' in the game is the work of the Core Cluster
    team. This team has the high level goal of developing our cluster technology to
    allow EVE to scale well into the future, even as we put more demands on it with
    more pilots inhabiting a more dynamic and developed EVE universe. This is no overnight
    fix and there have been some great discussions (as well as some painful ones) on
    EVE-O and other forums. Many of these threads have a good grasp, if not of the specifics,
    then of the general idea that we are trying to solve some of the hardest problems
    in a number of very complex disciplines. CCP Warlock works as the Distributed Systems
    Architect for CCP and the Core Cluster team and recently released an <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=778">
        excellent blog</a> on some of the challenges we are facing.</p>
<p>
    As recent blogs have started to describe, we are doing things right now to attack
    lag. We have people looking at specific bugs and issues which have been plaguing
    fleet fights. We are well aware that there are lag issues around large fleet fights
    (and some not so large ones) which are reducing your enjoyment of this part of EVE.
    We know because you have been telling us about your experiences regarding things
    like module lag, jump in lag and blackscreens to name just a few. We also know because
    we, as players ourselves (long time lurker, first time poster checking in after
    5 years playing) experience these issues. I will leave the specifics of our progress
    against these problems to the actual developers working on "lag" who can get low
    down and dirty with some real techy blogs.</p>
<p>
    Genuine progress on these issues is being made thanks to the tools being produced
    by Core Infrastructure that are being used by the Core Cluster and EVE development
    teams. The nature of the lag problem means that it takes time to diagnose and address
    the problems, but we have invested significantly in getting the right tools and
    people to help us identify and improve the situation as fast as possible. Once fixes
    have been deployed to TQ and we have real evidence that they are making a positive
    difference to your playing experience, you will see more Dev Blogs detailing the
    processes and fixes.</p>
<p>
    So in terms of teams and what we work on, that is the Core Technology Group as it
    stands right now. You can find some more information <a href="http://www.ccpgames.com/carbon">
        here</a>. We will continue to grow proportionately to CCP's development teams
    and the growing scope of the Carbon framework. We are actively recruiting into the
    CTG and if you are interested, you can apply at the usual place, <a href="http://www.ccpgames.com/en/jobs.aspx">
        the CCP jobs page.</a></p>
<p>
    Now that you hopefully have a bit more clarity on how CCPs Core teams are structured,
    it is important that you, the EVE players, know that the focus of the Core Technology
    Group is on supporting EVE and the experience of playing it. Through our Carbon
    strategy we make sure that all future product development at CCP feeds back into
    Eve, as they all integrate back to Carbon. We also make sure that CCP has a robust
    battletested core framework to win our war against the impossible.</p>
